By downloading, installing, executing, using, or modifying this Software, you are deemed to have legally agreed to all the terms of this Agreement and bear the legal responsibilities associated with it.

"Users" shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

## **Article 1 (Copyright and Ownership)**

## **Article 2 (Modification Rights and Distribution Restrictions)**

1. Users are free to modify and improve this Software.
    
2. However, **distributing the modified Software as an independent project or separate software is strictly prohibited.** This restriction prevents license circumvention and the release of competing products derived from this Software.
    
3. The following actions are **prohibited without prior written approval from the Licensor**:
    
    - Redistributing the Software in whole or in part in an exclusive format.
        
    - Unilaterally modifying the Software’s license.
        
## **Article 3 (Contributions)**

1. Contributions refer to modifications or content provided by users to improve this Software, such as through its GitHub repository or official Discord channel.
    
2. Contributors are deemed to agree to **transfer the copyright of their contributions to the Licensor** to maintain consistency in copyright ownership and clarify legal responsibilities.

## **Article 4 (Usage and Royalty Provisions)**

1. Users must use this Software **in compliance with the conditions of this Agreement**, regardless of whether their usage is for commercial or non-commercial purposes.
    
2. If a project utilizing this Software generates an **annual gross revenue exceeding USD 15,000**, the **royalty program applies specifically to that project**.
    
3. The royalty program details are as follows:
    
    - **If the annual revenue of a project using this Software exceeds USD 15,000, 1% of the excess amount must be paid to the Licensor.**  
        (For example, if the revenue is USD 25,000, the excess amount is USD 10,000, and the royalty is USD 100.)
        
    - **Annual revenue** refers to total revenue generated between January 1 and December 31 of the given year.
        
    - **The royalty applies to all revenue-generating mediums**, including but not limited to plugins, sub-plugins, frameworks, games, platforms, game engines, TV shows, videos, films, images, novels, texts, datasets, and corpora.
        
    - Even if multiple derivative software components are used, **the royalty is imposed only once per project.**  
        (For example, if a project simultaneously uses Joint Native and Joint Yggdrasil, only one royalty payment is required.)
        
    - **Separate projects are subject to separate royalty payments.** Each project is independently assessed and required to pay royalties accordingly.
        
    - The royalty payment process involves filling out the designated form on the Software's GitHub page, submitting the necessary financial details, and paying the calculated amount by the specified deadline.
        
    - If separate projects each use Joint, each project is independently subject to the Joint royalty program, meaning calculations and payment obligations apply separately to each.
        
    - To complete the royalty payment, users must provide the necessary revenue details, accept the calculated fee, and make the payment according to the issued invoice.
        
    - Once the information is submitted, the Licensor will issue an invoice and send it to the provided contact information (typically via email). Users must make the payment in full by the deadline stated in the invoice.
        
4. **If a project’s annual revenue does not exceed USD 15,000, the royalty program does not apply to that project.** Users in this category are not required to pay any fees but **must still provide revenue details for verification purposes.**
    
5. **For educational and non-commercial research purposes**, royalty fees may be waived **upon obtaining prior written approval from the Licensor**.
    
6. Users who fail to fulfill their royalty payment obligations **will be considered in breach of this Agreement**, and the Licensor may revoke their license and take legal action.
    
7. **Certain individuals or organizations designated by the Licensor may be exempt from royalty obligations.**
    
    - However, such exemptions **are granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor**, who reserves the right to review and modify exemptions on a case-by-case basis.
        
    - The exemption **cannot be transferred, sold, or assigned to a third party**, and the Licensor may change exemption eligibility at its discretion.
        
    - **Individuals or organizations that officially purchased the Software from Unreal Marketplace (or Fab) before April 25, 2025, are exempt from the royalty program.** Additionally, for these users, **the license terms applicable at the time of purchase will continue to apply to future versions of the Software** (e.g., Fab Standard License).
        
## **Article 5 (Rights and Restrictions for Derivative Software)**

1. **Derivative software (e.g., Joint Native Project, Joint Yggdrasil Project)** refers to APIs, plugins, or other software that operate in conjunction with this Software. However, simply modifying or improving this Software does not constitute derivative software.

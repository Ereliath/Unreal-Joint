# **Joint Plugin License Agreement**

This License Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement") establishes the rights and restrictions related to the use of the **Joint Plugin (hereinafter referred to as the "Software")**, which is solely owned by **DevGrain (GGgRain)** (hereinafter referred to as the "Licensor").

By downloading, installing, executing, using, or modifying this Software, you are deemed to have legally agreed to all the terms of this Agreement and bear the legal responsibilities associated with it.

"Users" shall mean an individual or legal entity exercising rights granted by this License.
## **Article 1 (Copyright and Ownership)**

1. The **Licensor exclusively owns all copyrights and intellectual property rights** to this Software, which is protected globally by copyright laws and other applicable laws. (Copyright (c) DevGrain (GGgRain), All rights reserved)
    
2. **All types of content included in this Software, such as source code, binaries, and assets (hereinafter referred to as "Content"), belong to the Licensor**, and users may not infringe upon these rights.
    
3. Users shall not claim any ownership over this Software, and the right to use the Software is **granted only under the conditions set forth in this Agreement**.
## **Article 2 (Modification Rights and Distribution Restrictions)**

1. Users are permitted to modify and improve this Software. However, any modified version of the Software must be distributed under the same Joint Plugin License without alterations to its licensing terms, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Licensor.

2. You may continue to use this software under the current license. Future versions of this license may be made available, and you are encouraged to review and adopt newer versions when applicable.
## **Article 3 (Contributions)**

1. **Contributions** refer to modifications, improvements, or content voluntarily provided by users to enhance this Software, including but not limited to contributions made via its GitHub repository or official Discord channel.
    
2. **Contributors retain the copyright to their contributions**. However, by submitting a contribution, contributors grant the Licensor a non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, sublicense, and distribute the contribution only within the scope of this Software, for the purpose of maintaining legal clarity and functional compatibility.
    
3. **Contributors confirm that their contributions do not infringe on any third-party rights, including copyrights, patents, or trade secrets.** The contributor shall be solely responsible for any legal disputes arising from their contributions.
    
4. **The Licensor is not obligated to accept or incorporate all contributions** and reserves the right to modify or remove contributions as necessary.
    
5. **Contributors may continue using their contributions in other projects** as long as doing so does not violate this Agreement or cause conflicts with the Software's licensing terms.

6. Contributors may request the removal or modification of their contributions within two (2) months of submission. The previously granted license under Article 3(2) shall remain valid and irrevocable for already released versions or derivatives, even if the original contribution is later modified or removed, unless a separate written agreement is reached. 

	- The Licensor shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate these requests in a manner consistent with the Software’s ongoing development and legal obligations. However, if the contribution has become an essential and non-removable component of a core feature, the Licensor may decline the removal or modification request to avoid substantial disruption or redevelopment. The granted license shall remain effective regardless of the removal, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
   
7. **Contributors who make significant technical contributions to the project’s development or business contributions such as promotion may receive additional benefits, such as reduced license fee, with the approval of the Licensor.**
        
## Article 4 (Usage and Fee Provisions)

1. Users must use this Software in accordance with the terms of this agreement, regardless of whether the purpose is commercial or non-commercial.

2. If the annual net profit of a project utilizing this Software does not exceed the license threshold, the license fee does not apply. In such cases, users are not required to make any payments or submit profit-related information by default. However, if requested by the Licensor for verification purposes, users may be required to provide limited and reasonable documentation demonstrating that the project did not generate a net profit.

3. If the annual net profit of a project utilizing this Software is positive and exceeds the license threshold ($15,000 USD, last updated on April 4, 2025), the one-time license fee will apply to that specific project.

4. No changes to license fee shall apply retroactively to any project versions shipped before the effective date of such change, unless the change is explicitly beneficial to the user (e.g., fee reductions, or expanded exemptions). In such cases, the Licensor may apply the change retroactively at its discretion, provided that doing so does not impose new obligations on the user.

5. The details of the license program are as follows:

	- If a project exceeds the net profit threshold, a one-time license fee of $299 USD (subject to future revision, last updated on June 27, 2025) must be paid to the Licensor.

	- "Annual net profit" refers to the total revenue generated during the applicable year (January 1 – December 31), minus all applicable business expenses directly related to the project. These may include, but are not limited to, sales taxes, platform or transaction fees, refunds, chargebacks, marketing expenses, development costs, and operational expenditures. "Annual net profit" is calculated based on revenue from all monetized channels directly attributable to the project/derivative software.
	
		- "Annual net profit" is calculated based on all revenue **directly generated through the commercial use, sale, licensing, or monetization of the project or derivative software**, including but not limited to game sales, in-app purchases, advertising revenue, and commercial platform earnings.
	
	    - **It does not include general-purpose donations or unrelated crowdfunding (e.g., Patreon or Ko-fi) unless such platforms are used specifically to sell, license, or grant access to the project or derivative software.**

	- a "project" refers to a game, app, film, animation, or similar work where the Software is directly embedded or executed as part of the shipped product.

	- Each qualifying project is evaluated independently and one-time license fee applies only once **per project**, regardless of the number of derivative software associated with.

	- To complete payment, users must fill out a form provided in Joint’s official GitHub repository and send it to the Licensor (email: devgrain13@gmail.com). The Licensor will issue an invoice based on the submitted information.

6. Modification of License Terms

	- The license fee amount and threshold may be revised. The Licensor must announce revisions at least two (2) months in advance via the official Discord and GitHub repository.

	- The Licensor shall engage in good faith discussions with users regarding changes, but final decisions rest with the Licensor.

7. For educational or non-commercial research purposes, the license fee may be waived only with prior written approval from the Licensor.

8. Failure to comply with this licensing obligation will be considered a breach of contract. The Licensor may take appropriate action, including license revocation or legal measures.

9. **Certain individuals or organizations may be exempt from license fee obligations or receive benefits, such as reduced fee application.** This applies to special cases: 

	- ***Individuals or organizations that officially purchased the Software from Unreal Marketplace (or Fab) before April 12, 2025, are exempt from the one-time license fee.**
	        
	- The exemption and benefits **cannot be transferred, sold, or assigned to a third party**, and the Licensor may change exemption eligibility at its discretion.
  
## **Article 5 (Rights and Restrictions for Derivative Software)**

1. **Derivative software (e.g., Joint Native Project, Joint Yggdrasil Project)** refers to any software that directly embeds, extends, or depends on core functional components of this Software for its execution or delivery of main features, including but not limited to APIs, plugins, or platforms. It includes commercially released or publicly distributed software that incorporates or builds upon this Software's original code, structure, or essential logic. This does not include software that only interfaces with this Software through publicly documented APIs or file formats, nor software that merely uses its outputs without embedding or integrating its core components. For clarity, “derivative software” does not include “projects” as defined in Article 4 (e.g., games, apps, films, or similar products in which the Software is directly embedded). These are subject to the licensing terms in Article 4, not Article 5.

	- Examples of core functional components include Joint’s runtime modules, proprietary interface layers, or any compiled or script-based logic critical to the Software’s intended operations. Merely referencing or loading data outputs from the Software does not constitute a derivative work.
	- **Modified versions of Joint itself** (e.g., altered builds or enhanced variants) that are distributed as standalone products and generate revenue - outside the context of “projects” defined in Article 4 - shall be considered derivative software and subject to the royalty program outlined in this Article.
	- However, if such modified versions do not generate revenue and are distributed non-commercially, they shall be treated as **modified software**, not derivative software. In such cases, distribution must comply with the terms of the **Joint Plugin License**, including the obligation to retain the original license terms.

2. **Derivative software developers may hold ownership over independent content (e.g., source code, binaries, and assets) that is not part of this Software.**
    
3. If revenue is generated from derivative software, **the royalty program for this Software must be adhered to.**

4. No changes to royalty rates, or thresholds shall apply retroactively to any project versions shipped before the effective date of such change, unless the change is explicitly beneficial to the user (e.g., expanded exemptions, or increased thresholds, reduced royalty percentage). In such cases, the Licensor may apply the change retroactively at its discretion, provided that doing so does not impose new obligations on the user.
   
5. **License Notice Requirement for Derivative Software**
    
    - Derivative software license documents must include the following notice, which must be clearly communicated to users of your Derivative Software:
        
        **"Using this derivative software is considered equivalent to using Joint, and users agree to comply with the Joint Plugin License Agreement and its associated license fee program when using a project that utilizes the derivative software."**
        
6. **Guidelines for Distributing Derivative Software**

    - Derivative software may be freely distributed without requiring prior written approval from the Licensor, including for commercial use, as long as it complies with this Agreement and includes the required license notice.

    - The Licensor encourages developers to innovate and share derivative software to enrich the ecosystem. However, if a particular derivative software demonstrably causes serious concerns—such as copyright infringement, intentional misuse of the Joint brand, deceptive licensing representation, or clearly harmful pricing practices—the Licensor may request modifications.

    - Such action will be considered only when clearly necessary to protect the Joint community and its reputation, and only after reasonable efforts at consultation, feedback, or collaborative resolution have been attempted in good faith.

7. **Royalty Program for Derivative Software**

    - If the annual net profit of a piece of **derivative software** utilizing this Software does not exceed the royalty threshold, the royalty program does not apply to that derivative software. In such cases, users are not required to make any royalty payments or submit profit-related information by default. However, **if requested by the Licensor for verification purposes**, users may be required to provide **limited and reasonable documentation demonstrating that derivative software did not generate a net profit**. Acceptable documentation may include summarized financial statements, expense reports, or comparable materials sufficient to verify the absence of profit. The scope of such requests shall remain proportionate and respect the confidentiality of the user's business operations.

    - If the annual net profit of a derivative software utilizing this Software is positive and exceeds the royalty threshold ($15,000 USD, last updated on April 4, 2025), the royalty program will apply to that specific derivative software.

    - The details of the royalty program are as follows:

        - If the annual net profit of a derivative software using this Software exceeds the royalty threshold, the Licensor must be paid a royalty percentage (1%, last updated on April 4, 2025) on the portion of net profit exceeding the threshold.

        - "Annual net profit" refers to the total revenue generated during the applicable year (January 1 – December 31), minus all applicable business expenses directly related to the derivative software. These may include, but are not limited to, sales taxes, platform or transaction fees, refunds, chargebacks, marketing expenses, development costs, and operational expenditures. For any items not expressly specified in this clause, deductions shall be determined on a case-by-case basis at the sole discretion of the Licensor.
    
	        - "Annual net profit" is calculated based on all revenue **directly generated through the commercial use, sale, licensing, or monetization of the project or derivative software**, including but not limited to game sales, in-app purchases, advertising revenue, and commercial platform earnings.
	    
	        - **It does not include general-purpose donations or unrelated crowdfunding (e.g., Patreon or Ko-fi) unless such platforms are used specifically to sell, license, or grant access to the project or derivative software.**

        - However, passive usage such as inspiration, references, or indirect influence without direct integration does not fall under royalty obligations.

        - The royalty payment process requires completing a form provided in Joint’s official GitHub repository. Users must submit sufficient information to calculate the derivative software's annual net profit and send the completed form to the Licensor (typically via email: devgrain13@gmail.com). Payment must be completed according to the invoice issued by the Licensor, within the specified deadline. The process may be updated and publicly announced by the Licensor at a later date.

        - After receiving the submitted information, the Licensor will issue an invoice and send it to the contact details provided by the user. Users must pay the exact amount specified in the invoice by the stated deadline.

    - **Modification and Limitations of Royalty Terms**

        - The applicable figures for the royalty percentage and royalty threshold may change upon revision. The Licensor is obligated to notify users of such changes and will announce each revision and its details via the official Discord and GitHub repository.

        - **Changes to the royalty percentage or royalty threshold must be announced at least two (2) months in advance.** The Licensor must notify users via the official Discord and GitHub repository.
	    
        - During this period, the Licensor **shall engage in discussions with users** to address concerns and adjustments regarding the changes. However, the final decision remains at the discretion of the Licensor.
	    
        - **The Licensor is obligated to make adjustments in a reasonable and fair manner**, considering industry standards, market conditions, and user feedback. While user input will be taken into account, the Licensor retains the authority to implement necessary changes as long as they fall within the agreed limits of this Agreement.
	    
        - **When increasing the royalty percentage**, the Licensor must raise it by no more than 0.5% every six months, based on a mid-year division around June 30. Under no circumstances shall the royalty percentage exceed a maximum cap of 3%.
	    
        - **There are no specific limitations on changes to the royalty threshold, but the threshold shall not be set below $10,000 USD under any circumstances.**

    - **For educational and non-commercial research purposes**, royalties may be waived **only with prior written approval from the Licensor**.

    - Failure to comply with royalty payment obligations **will be considered a breach of contract, and the Licensor may take appropriate actions, including license revocation and legal measures**.
    
    - **Certain individuals or organizations may be exempt from royalty obligations or receive benefits, such as reduced royalty rate application by their contribution on the ecosystem.**

## **Article 6 (Breach of Agreement and Legal Actions)**

1. If a user **fails to comply** with this Agreement, the Licensor may **temporarily suspend or, if necessary, terminate the license**. However, in most cases, the user will be given a **reasonable opportunity and timeframe—at least three (3) months from the Licensor’s notification—to correct the issue.** The Licensor may grant additional time depending on the circumstances
    
2. The Licensor **reserves the right to take appropriate legal action in cases of serious copyright or intellectual property violations**, including seeking compensation for damages if necessary.

3. If a violation occurs outside South Korea, the Licensor may take action in accordance with **applicable international laws**. Depending on the situation, possible measures may include:
    
    - Requesting compliance with copyright laws (e.g., DMCA, EU Copyright Directive, GDPR, etc.)
        
    - Resolving disputes through local legal channels, if deemed necessary
        
    - Requesting content removal from online platforms (e.g., Steam, Epic Games Store, GitHub) to prevent unauthorized distribution
        
    - Considering international arbitration under ICC or UNCITRAL as an alternative to litigation
        
4. Users who cause financial or reputational harm to the Licensor due to a breach of this Agreement may be held responsible for **reasonable legal costs** incurred in resolving the issue, as permitted by applicable laws.

5. This Software is provided “as-is,” without any warranties or guarantees, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

2. **If a user resides outside South Korea, alternative legal venues may be considered** to ensure a fair and accessible resolution process. The Licensor and the user may mutually agree to resolve disputes in a **jurisdiction more accessible to the user**, provided that the alternative jurisdiction does not compromise the Licensor's legal protections.

3. **International Arbitration Option**: Instead of litigation, either party may choose to resolve disputes through arbitration under the **ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) or UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law)** rules. Arbitration may take place **in a neutral location mutually agreed upon by both parties**, rather than being restricted to Seoul, South Korea.
    
4. **Binding and Enforceable Decisions**: Any arbitration ruling shall be legally binding upon both parties, and if necessary, it may be enforced in the courts of relevant jurisdictions.
    
5. **Compliance with International Laws**: If applicable, the Licensor may take additional legal actions under relevant international laws, such as **DMCA, GDPR, or other jurisdiction-specific regulations**, to ensure compliance with copyright and intellectual property laws.

## **Article 8 (Amendments and Revisions)**

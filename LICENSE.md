## **Article 4 (Usage and Royalty Provisions)**

1. Users must use this software in accordance with the terms of this agreement, **regardless of whether the purpose is commercial or non-commercial**.

2. If the annual total revenue of a project utilizing this software **does not exceed the royalty threshold**, **the royalty program does not apply to that project.** In this case, users are not required to make any payments, and they are also not obligated to submit revenue-related information for the royalty program.

3. If the annual total revenue of a project utilizing this software **exceeds the royalty threshold ($15,000 USD, last updated on April 4, 2024)**, **the royalty program will apply to that specific project**.
    
4. The details of the royalty program are as follows:
    
    - **If the annual revenue of a project using this software exceeds the royalty threshold, the Licensor must be paid a royalty percentage (1%, last updated on April 4, 2024) on the excess amount.**
        
    - **Annual revenue** refers to the total revenue generated during the applicable year (January 1 – December 31).
        
    - A "project" subject to royalties includes all revenue-generating software or media in which this Software is directly integrated, executed, or utilized as a core component. This includes but is not limited to **plugins, sub-plugins, frameworks, games, platforms, and game engines** where this Software is actively running as part of the final product. **Additionally, if this Software is used as a core element in datasets, movies, animations, or similar media—such that its functionality or output is essential to the final product—those projects are also subject to royalties.** 
    
    - However, passive usage such as inspiration, references, or indirect influence without direct integration does not fall under royalty obligations.
        
    - Even if multiple derivative software solutions are used, **royalties for this software are only charged once per project.** (e.g., if a project uses both Joint Native and Joint Yggdrasil simultaneously, royalties are charged only once.)
        
    - If separate projects each use Joint, then each project is subject to a separate Joint royalty program. This means the calculation of amounts and payment obligations occur separately for each project.
        
    - The royalty payment process requires filling out a form provided in Joint's official GitHub repository, attaching the necessary information for revenue calculation and payment, and sending the completed form to the Licensor (typically via email: devgrain13@gmail.com). Payment must be completed according to an invoice issued by the Licensor, within the specified deadline. The exact process may be updated and announced later.
        
    - After submitting the required information for royalty calculation, the Licensor will issue an invoice and send it to the contact information provided during submission (typically via email). Users must pay the exact amount specified in the invoice by the stated deadline.
    
5. **Modification and Limitations of Royalty Terms**

    - The applicable figures for the royalty percentage and royalty threshold may change upon revision. The Licensor is obligated to notify users of such changes and will announce each revision and its details via the official Discord and GitHub repository.

	- **Changes to the royalty percentage or royalty threshold must be announced at least two (2) months in advance.** The Licensor must notify users via the official Discord and GitHub repository.
	    
	- During this period, the Licensor **shall engage in discussions with users** to address concerns and adjustments regarding the changes. However, the final decision remains at the discretion of the Licensor.
	    
	- **The Licensor is obligated to make adjustments in a reasonable and fair manner**, considering industry standards, market conditions, and user feedback. While user input will be taken into account, the Licensor retains the authority to implement necessary changes as long as they fall within the agreed limits of this Agreement.
	    
	- **When increasing the royalty percentage**, the Licensor may raise it by a maximum of **0.5% over a six-month period**, divided into quarterly increments of up to **0.5% per quarter** based on a mid-year division around June 30. **However, under no circumstances shall the royalty percentage exceed a maximum cap of 3%.**
	    
	- **There are no specific limitations on changes to the royalty threshold, but the threshold shall not be set below $10,000 USD under any circumstances.**
	    
6. **For educational and non-commercial research purposes**, royalties may be waived **only with prior written approval from the Licensor**.
    
7. Failure to comply with royalty payment obligations **will be considered a breach of contract, and the Licensor may take appropriate actions, including license revocation and legal measures**.
    
8. **Certain individuals or organizations designated by the Licensor may be exempt from royalty obligations.** This is only for the special cases: 

     - ***Individuals or organizations that officially purchased the Software from Unreal Marketplace (or Fab) before April 12, 2025, are exempt from the royalty program.** Additionally, for these users, **the license terms applicable at the time of purchase will continue to apply to future versions of the Software** (e.g., Fab Standard License).

		- However, such exemptions **are granted solely at the discretion of the Licensor**, who retains the right to review, approve, or modify each exemption on a case-by-case basis. **This provision is intended to prevent abuse or inequitable application of the license terms.
	        
	    - The exemption **cannot be transferred, sold, or assigned to a third party**, and the Licensor may change exemption eligibility at its discretion.
	    
	    - In this case, The users must provide their Order ID to let the Licensor identify each individuals.
        
## **Article 5 (Rights and Restrictions for Derivative Software)**

1. **Derivative software (e.g., Joint Native Project, Joint Yggdrasil Project)** refers to APIs, plugins, or other software that operate in conjunction with this Software. However, simply modifying or improving this Software does not constitute derivative software.
    
2. **Derivative software developers may hold ownership over independent content (e.g., source code, binaries, and assets) that is not part of this Software.**
    
3. If revenue is generated from derivative software, **the royalty program for this Software must be adhered to.**
    
4. **License Notice Requirement for Derivative Software**
    
    - Derivative software license documents must include the following notice, which must be clearly communicated to users of your Derivative Software:
        
        **"Using this derivative software is considered equivalent to using Joint, and users agree to comply with the Joint Plugin License Agreement and its associated royalty program when using a project that utilizes the derivative software."**
        
    - Additionally, users of derivative software must be clearly informed about amendments to this Agreement, including the Joint Royalty Program.
        
5. **Guidelines for Distributing Derivative Software**

	- Distribution of derivative software is generally subject to the Licensor's prior written approval. Contributors are encouraged to provide sufficient details when making such requests to facilitate a smooth review process.
	
	- If any changes are made to the distribution format or key details after approval, the Licensor should be promptly informed. The Licensor may suggest adjustments or impose additional conditions based on the nature of the modifications.
	
	- However, if a derivative software is found to pose significant concerns—such as copyright infringement, severely poor quality, misleading licensing practices, or excessive pricing—that are deemed to substantially harm the reputation of Joint, its user base, or the rights and interests of the Licensor, **the Licensor reserves the right to restrict the distribution of such software**. **This right shall be exercised only as a last resort**, when other means such as consultation or revision requests have failed or are deemed insufficient to prevent harm.
        
## **Article 6 (Breach of Agreement and Legal Actions)**

1. If a user **fails to comply** with this Agreement, the Licensor may **temporarily suspend or, if necessary, terminate the license**. However, in most cases, the user will be given a **reasonable opportunity and timeframe—at least three (3) months from the Licensor’s notification—to correct the issue.** The Licensor may grant additional time depending on the circumstances
    
2. The Licensor **reserves the right to take appropriate legal action in cases of serious copyright or intellectual property violations**, including seeking compensation for damages if necessary.

3. If a violation occurs outside South Korea, the Licensor may take action in accordance with **applicable international laws**. Depending on the situation, possible measures may include:
    
    - Requesting compliance with copyright laws (e.g., DMCA, EU Copyright Directive, GDPR, etc.)
        
    - Resolving disputes through local legal channels, if deemed necessary
        
    - Requesting content removal from online platforms (e.g., Steam, Epic Games Store, GitHub) to prevent unauthorized distribution
        
    - Considering international arbitration under ICC or UNCITRAL as an alternative to litigation
        
4. Users who cause financial or reputational harm to the Licensor due to a breach of this Agreement may be held responsible for **reasonable legal costs** incurred in resolving the issue, as permitted by applicable laws.
    
## **Article 7 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction)**

1. This Agreement is **primarily** governed by the laws of South Korea, and legal disputes shall **preferentially** be resolved in South Korean courts.
    
2. **If a user resides outside South Korea, alternative legal venues may be considered** to ensure a fair and accessible resolution process. The Licensor and the user may mutually agree to resolve disputes in a **jurisdiction more accessible to the user**, provided that the alternative jurisdiction does not compromise the Licensor's legal protections.

3. **International Arbitration Option**: Instead of litigation, either party may choose to resolve disputes through arbitration under the **ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) or UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law)** rules. Arbitration may take place **in a neutral location mutually agreed upon by both parties**, rather than being restricted to Seoul, South Korea.
    
4. **Binding and Enforceable Decisions**: Any arbitration ruling shall be legally binding upon both parties, and if necessary, it may be enforced in the courts of relevant jurisdictions.
    
5. **Compliance with International Laws**: If applicable, the Licensor may take additional legal actions under relevant international laws, such as **DMCA, GDPR, or other jurisdiction-specific regulations**, to ensure compliance with copyright and intellectual property laws.

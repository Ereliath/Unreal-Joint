# **Joint Plugin License Agreement**

This License Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement") establishes the rights and restrictions related to the use of the **Joint Plugin (hereinafter referred to as the "Software")**, which is solely owned by **DevGrain (GGgRain)** (hereinafter referred to as the "Licensor").

By downloading, installing, executing, using, or modifying this Software, you are deemed to have legally agreed to all the terms of this Agreement and bear the legal responsibilities associated with it.

"Users" shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

## **Article 1 (Copyright and Ownership)**

1. The **Licensor exclusively owns all copyrights and intellectual property rights** to this Software, which is protected globally by copyright laws and other applicable laws. (Copyright (c) DevGrain (GGgRain), All rights reserved)
    
2. **All types of content included in this Software, such as source code, binaries, and assets (hereinafter referred to as "Content"), belong to the Licensor**, and users may not infringe upon these rights.
    
3. Users shall not claim any ownership over this Software, and the right to use the Software is **granted only under the conditions set forth in this Agreement**.
    
## **Article 2 (Modification Rights and Distribution Restrictions)**

1. Users are free to modify and improve this Software.
    
2. However, **distributing the modified Software itself (a modified version of Joint) as an independent or separate project in any public manner is prohibited**. This restriction prevents license circumvention and the release of competing products derived from this Software.

3. Modifications may be shared within an organization or with written approval from the Licensor.

4. Any modified Softwares must have the same license policy, Joint Plugin License, without further modification. And must be revised according to each revision of the original license.
   
5. The following actions are **prohibited without prior written approval from the Licensor**:
    
    - Redistributing the Software in whole or in part in an exclusive format.
        
    - Unilaterally modifying the Software’s license.
   
6. These restrictions are set strictly to protect copyright and intellectual property rights. However, if these terms significantly hinder necessary activities, users may discuss separate arrangements with the Licensor to apply this Agreement differently on a case-by-case basis.
        
## **Article 3 (Contributions)**

1. **Contributions** refer to modifications, improvements, or content voluntarily provided by users to enhance this Software, including but not limited to contributions made via its GitHub repository or official Discord channel.
    
2. **Contributors retain the copyright** to their contributions. However, by submitting a contribution, contributors grant the Licensor a **non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, modify, sublicense, and distribute the contribution **only within the scope of this Software** to ensure compatibility and legal clarity.
    
3. **Contributors confirm that their contributions do not infringe on any third-party rights, including copyrights, patents, or trade secrets.** The contributor shall be solely responsible for any legal disputes arising from their contributions.
    
4. **The Licensor is not obligated to accept or incorporate all contributions** and reserves the right to modify or remove contributions as necessary.
    
5. **Contributors may continue using their contributions in other projects** as long as doing so does not violate this Agreement or cause conflicts with the Software's licensing terms.

6. **Contributors may request the removal or modification of their contributions within two (2) months of submission.** The specifics of such requests, including code removal or modification, shall be coordinated with the Licensor. The Licensor must make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests unless the contribution has become an **essential and non-removable component** of a core feature of the Software, such that its removal would cause substantial disruption or require significant redevelopment.

7. **Contributors who make significant technical contributions to the project’s development or business contributions such as promotion may receive additional benefits, such as reduced royalty rates, with the approval of the Licensor.**
        
## Article 4 (Usage and Royalty Provisions)

1. Users must use this Software in accordance with the terms of this agreement, regardless of whether the purpose is commercial or non-commercial.

2. If the annual net profit of a project utilizing this Software does not exceed the royalty threshold, the royalty program does not apply to that project. In such cases, users are not required to make any royalty payments or submit profit-related information by default. However, **if requested by the Licensor for verification purposes**, users may be required to provide **limited and reasonable documentation demonstrating that the project did not generate a net profit**. Acceptable documentation may include summarized financial statements, expense reports, or comparable materials sufficient to verify the absence of profit. The scope of such requests shall remain proportionate and respect the confidentiality of the user's business operations.

3. If the annual net profit of a project utilizing this Software is positive and exceeds the royalty threshold ($15,000 USD, last updated on April 4, 2025), the royalty program will apply to that specific project.

4. The details of the royalty program are as follows:

    - If the annual net profit of a project using this Software exceeds the royalty threshold, the Licensor must be paid a royalty percentage (1%, last updated on April 4, 2025) on the portion of net profit exceeding the threshold.

    - **"Annual net profit"** refers to the total revenue generated during the applicable year (January 1 – December 31), minus all applicable business expenses directly related to the project. These may include, but are not limited to, sales taxes, platform or transaction fees, refunds, chargebacks, marketing expenses, development costs, and operational expenditures.

    - A **"project"** subject to royalties includes all revenue-generating software or media in which this Software is directly integrated, executed, or utilized as a core component. This includes but is not limited to plugins, sub-plugins, frameworks, games, platforms, and game engines where this Software is actively running as part of the final product. Additionally, if this Software is used as a core element in datasets, movies, animations, or similar media—such that its functionality or output is essential to the final product—those projects are also subject to royalties.

    - However, passive usage such as inspiration, references, or indirect influence without direct integration does not fall under royalty obligations.

    - Even if multiple derivative software components are used, royalties for this Software are only charged once per project. (e.g., if a project uses both Joint Native and Joint Yggdrasil simultaneously, royalties are charged only once.)

    - If separate projects each use Joint, then each project is subject to a separate royalty program. This means the threshold and royalty payment obligations are calculated independently for each project.

    - The royalty payment process requires completing a form provided in Joint’s official GitHub repository. Users must submit sufficient information to calculate the project's annual net profit and send the completed form to the Licensor (typically via email: devgrain13@gmail.com). Payment must be completed according to the invoice issued by the Licensor, within the specified deadline. The process may be updated and publicly announced by the Licensor at a later date.

    - After receiving the submitted information, the Licensor will issue an invoice and send it to the contact details provided by the user. Users must pay the exact amount specified in the invoice by the stated deadline.

5. **Modification and Limitations of Royalty Terms**

    - The applicable figures for the royalty percentage and royalty threshold may change upon revision. The Licensor is obligated to notify users of such changes and will announce each revision and its details via the official Discord and GitHub repository.

	- **Changes to the royalty percentage or royalty threshold must be announced at least two (2) months in advance.** The Licensor must notify users via the official Discord and GitHub repository.
	    
	- During this period, the Licensor **shall engage in discussions with users** to address concerns and adjustments regarding the changes. However, the final decision remains at the discretion of the Licensor.
	    
	- **The Licensor is obligated to make adjustments in a reasonable and fair manner**, considering industry standards, market conditions, and user feedback. While user input will be taken into account, the Licensor retains the authority to implement necessary changes as long as they fall within the agreed limits of this Agreement.
	    
	- **When increasing the royalty percentage**, the Licensor must raise it by no more than 0.5% every six months, based on a mid-year division around June 30. Under no circumstances shall the royalty percentage exceed a maximum cap of 3%.
	    
	- **There are no specific limitations on changes to the royalty threshold, but the threshold shall not be set below $10,000 USD under any circumstances.**
	    
6. **For educational and non-commercial research purposes**, royalties may be waived **only with prior written approval from the Licensor**.
    
7. Failure to comply with royalty payment obligations **will be considered a breach of contract, and the Licensor may take appropriate actions, including license revocation and legal measures**.
    
8. **Certain individuals or organizations may be exempt from royalty obligations or receive benefits, such as reduced royalty rate application.** This applies to special cases: 

	- ***Individuals or organizations that officially purchased the Software from Unreal Marketplace (or Fab) before April 12, 2025, are exempt or take discounts from the royalty program.** Additionally, for these users, **the license terms applicable at the time of purchase will continue to apply to future versions of the Software** (e.g., Fab Standard License).

		- This royalty exemption and benefit provision is intended to reward users who have supported and used Joint projects from the beginning. As a result, the support will be differentiated based on specific periods.
   
		- Specifically, users who purchased the plugin between the first release of Simple Dialogue System (the prior product of Joint) and March 21, 2025, will be exempt from the royalty program. Other users may receive at least a 30% royalty price discount or more on a case-by-case basis.

		- The changes in this provision will not be applied retroactively, and users can receive benefits according to the Joint License terms that were in place at the time of their purchase.

		- In this case, the users must provide their Order ID to let the Licensor identify each individual.

	- However, such exemptions and benefits **are granted solely at the discretion of the Licensor**, who retains the right to review, approve, or modify each exemption on a case-by-case basis. **This provision is intended to prevent abuse or inequitable application of the license terms.
	        
	- The exemption and benefits **cannot be transferred, sold, or assigned to a third party**, and the Licensor may change exemption eligibility at its discretion.
  
	- Users who make significant technical contributions to the project’s development or business contributions such as promotion may receive additional benefits, such as reduced royalty rates, with the approval of the Licensor.
        
## **Article 5 (Rights and Restrictions for Derivative Software)**

1. **Derivative software (e.g., Joint Native Project, Joint Yggdrasil Project)** refers to APIs, plugins, or other software that operate in conjunction with this Software. However, simply modifying or improving this Software does not constitute derivative software.
    
2. **Derivative software developers may hold ownership over independent content (e.g., source code, binaries, and assets) that is not part of this Software.**
    
3. If revenue is generated from derivative software, **the royalty program for this Software must be adhered to.**
    
4. **License Notice Requirement for Derivative Software**
    
    - Derivative software license documents must include the following notice, which must be clearly communicated to users of your Derivative Software:
        
        **"Using this derivative software is considered equivalent to using Joint, and users agree to comply with the Joint Plugin License Agreement and its associated royalty program when using a project that utilizes the derivative software."**
        
    - Additionally, users of derivative software must be clearly informed about amendments to this Agreement, including the Joint Royalty Program.
        
5. **Guidelines for Distributing Derivative Software**

	- Distribution of derivative software is generally subject to the Licensor's prior written approval. Contributors are encouraged to provide sufficient details when making such requests to facilitate a smooth review process.
	
	- If any changes are made to the distribution format or key details after approval, the Licensor should be promptly informed. The Licensor may suggest adjustments or impose additional conditions based on the nature of the modifications.
	
	- However, if a derivative software is found to pose significant concerns—such as copyright infringement, severely poor quality, misleading licensing practices, or excessive pricing—that are deemed to substantially harm the reputation of Joint, its user base, or the rights and interests of the Licensor, **the Licensor reserves the right to restrict the distribution of such software**. **This right shall be exercised only as a last resort**, when other means such as consultation or revision requests have failed or are deemed insufficient to prevent harm.
        
## **Article 6 (Breach of Agreement and Legal Actions)**

1. If a user **fails to comply** with this Agreement, the Licensor may **temporarily suspend or, if necessary, terminate the license**. However, in most cases, the user will be given a **reasonable opportunity and timeframe—at least three (3) months from the Licensor’s notification—to correct the issue.** The Licensor may grant additional time depending on the circumstances
    
2. The Licensor **reserves the right to take appropriate legal action in cases of serious copyright or intellectual property violations**, including seeking compensation for damages if necessary.

3. If a violation occurs outside South Korea, the Licensor may take action in accordance with **applicable international laws**. Depending on the situation, possible measures may include:
    
    - Requesting compliance with copyright laws (e.g., DMCA, EU Copyright Directive, GDPR, etc.)
        
    - Resolving disputes through local legal channels, if deemed necessary
        
    - Requesting content removal from online platforms (e.g., Steam, Epic Games Store, GitHub) to prevent unauthorized distribution
        
    - Considering international arbitration under ICC or UNCITRAL as an alternative to litigation
        
4. Users who cause financial or reputational harm to the Licensor due to a breach of this Agreement may be held responsible for **reasonable legal costs** incurred in resolving the issue, as permitted by applicable laws.
    
## **Article 7 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction)**

1. This Agreement is **primarily** governed by the laws of South Korea, and legal disputes shall **preferentially** be resolved in South Korean courts.
    
2. **If a user resides outside South Korea, alternative legal venues may be considered** to ensure a fair and accessible resolution process. The Licensor and the user may mutually agree to resolve disputes in a **jurisdiction more accessible to the user**, provided that the alternative jurisdiction does not compromise the Licensor's legal protections.

3. **International Arbitration Option**: Instead of litigation, either party may choose to resolve disputes through arbitration under the **ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) or UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law)** rules. Arbitration may take place **in a neutral location mutually agreed upon by both parties**, rather than being restricted to Seoul, South Korea.
    
4. **Binding and Enforceable Decisions**: Any arbitration ruling shall be legally binding upon both parties, and if necessary, it may be enforced in the courts of relevant jurisdictions.
    
5. **Compliance with International Laws**: If applicable, the Licensor may take additional legal actions under relevant international laws, such as **DMCA, GDPR, or other jurisdiction-specific regulations**, to ensure compliance with copyright and intellectual property laws.

## **Article 8 (Amendments and Revisions)**

1. This Agreement was first established on April 5, 2025 (Initial Revision Date), and takes effect from that date.

2. Amendments to this Agreement shall take effect 7 days after official notification, unless otherwise specified.

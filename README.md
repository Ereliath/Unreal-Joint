## :inbox_tray: Related Projects & Derivative Projects ##

There are some derivative projects that can be worked with Joint!

Currently We provide **Joint Native**, an completely-free-open-source project (apache-2.0) that provides built-in fragment and asset sets for basic and common dialogue productions.

Playing sounds, triggering animations, spawning actors, granting items or quests... Whatever it is, if Unreal Engine Can do it, you can make it a fragment and attach it to your dialogue.

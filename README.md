## :mag: About ##

Joint is Unreal Engine 4 & 5's strongest modular gameplay scripting framework for every type of projects.

Joint is a powerful tool for game developers, designers. You can create complex productions where your needs a power of modularity with whatever gameplay mechanics you want to use with Joint, using very intuitive, the state-of-the-art visual scripting interface.

> [!NOTE]
> Joint is a "General Purpose Modular Playback System" that can be used on the many range and system, so we expand its range with sub-plugins for each category.
> And currently we support "Advanced Narrative System" extension in the form of **Joint Native**, and many others can come along, or you can make your own usage with the framework.

Do you like the dialogue production of Animal Crossing, or the dialogue system of The Witcher 3? Or do you want to create your own unique dialogue system? Check out **Joint Native**.

Do you need a replacement for level sequencer for better after-localization synchoronization? Use Joint for such action!

## :inbox_tray: Related Projects & Derivative Projects ##

There are some derivative projects that can be worked with Joint!

Currently We provide **Joint Native**, an advanced tool designed to empower developers and storytellers to create highly customizable and dynamic narrative experiences. It supports a wide range of applications, from simple dialogues to complex, interactive storytelling systems inspired by games like Hogwarts Legacy or The Witcher 3. The system offers maximum control over participants, events, and the surrounding world, enabling intricate narrative designs.

Also, We also provide **Volt** plugin (MIT License), Unreal Slate Architecture Animation Framework, that was originally developed as a part of Joint to provide cool editor animation and interactions. If you have interest, please take a look into it.

## :clipboard: Main Features ##

### 1. Implement, and Stack Modules To Build Incredible Playback Production

Joint allows you to bring any gameplay mechanics or data you need on the script graph in the form of a module called **Fragment**.

Playing sounds, triggering animations, spawning actors, granting items or quests... Whatever it is, if Unreal Engine Can do it, you can make it a fragment and attach it to your playback chain.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc160e72-b8fd-4f14-aa55-3c0495c0fa4a

> [!NOTE]
> In Joint Native 1.12.2, you can find 39 fragments and assets for:
> * Basic Text-Based Dialogue (Text, Text Style)
> * Audio and Dubbing Based Dialogue (Dialogue Voice, Dialogue Wave)
> * Level Sequencer Controlled Dialogue
> * Dialogue Widget Related (Custom Rendering, render size, alpha, location interpolation control, Portrait system with participants) & Participant Control
> * Player Controller Control & Player Interactions Based Dialogue Control (Wait Skip until certain players are ready, Vote between players to select next branch to move)
> * Conditional Branching & Flow Control & Conditional Playback of Fragments
> * Sub Dialogue Control
> * Networking & Localization Based Control (On Server, On Client, On Standalone, etc, Culture Specific Playback Control)
> 
> \+ There are many more than these! Check out the full list [here](https://github.com/GGgRain/Unreal-Joint-Native), and more will be added in the future update

### 2. Powerful & Intuitive, Thus Easy Scripting With Joint Graph Editor

Joint is deeply considered to be easy and intuitive to use, even for those who are not familiar with programming.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e836a7af-840b-4466-ad5b-3c277b21e8e3

### 3. COMPLETE Multiplayer Support Via RPC & Replication for ALL FRAGMENTS

Joint is designed to be fully multiplayer compatible. Fragments in Joint can be replicated and called RPC; via them, you can easily make your fragments work in multiplayer games.

For example, watch how Vote fragment from Joint Native make between players select the next branch to move in a dialogue in the networked game!

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e45556a9-fa5d-49de-a74c-f591be52beb5

> [!NOTE]
> You can check out the full blueprint logic for each of the nodes in [Joint Native](https://github.com/GGgRain/Unreal-Joint-Native). It's also free, So take a look!

### 4. Reactive & Dynamic Playback - Even in Multiplayer, Even After Localization, Even Between Clients with Different Languages

Joint uses nodes(modules) to build up whole scripts - and using modules and modular playback system has really cool advantages over time-based playback systems!

It allows you to dynamically control the total playback length and timing of elements in your playback‚Äîsuch as sounds and animations‚Äîenabling perfectly timed playback delivery for your players, regardless of their client's language or cultural context. This works seamlessly **even in multiplayer session** and **after localization**, **across clients using different languages**, delivering **a perfectly synchronized playback experience tailored to each client**.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d861681-26c1-4696-95d7-25dbf227d936

### 5. PERFECT QOL Features

Joint provides a bunch of cool editor features that provides the perfect editing experiences that can boost your productivity and stoping you from banging your head against a wall!

See what major editor features Joint provides!

4. Launch your project and confirm it runs successfully. If you see a prompt asking about building modules, click **Yes**.

> [!TIP] 
> Check this out, especially if you've never compiled or used C++ code on your Unreal Engine before:
> If the plugin doesn‚Äôt launch properly, you may check your machine's Visual Studio configuration for the C++ code build to be valid. Please make sure to follow these steps:
> 
> In your Visual Studio configuration (you can modify it in Visual Studio Installer) :
> * Click Modify on the 2022 version
> * Go to Individual components
> * Type ‚ÄúMSVC‚Äù in the search bar

> * Then click modify in the bottom right corner
>
> Second, You have to install **Game development with C++** workload as well.

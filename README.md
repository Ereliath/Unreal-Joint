## :inbox_tray: Related Projects & Derivative Projects ##

There are some derivative projects that can be worked with Joint!

Currently We provide **Joint Native**, an completely-free-open-source project (apache-2.0) that provides built-in fragment and asset sets for basic and common dialogue productions.

Also, We also provide **Volt** plugin (MIT License), Unreal Slate Architecture Animation Framework, that was originally developed as a part of Joint to provide cool editor animation and interactions. If you have interest, please take a look into it.

## :clipboard: Main Features ##

### 1. Implement, and Stack Dialogue Features To Build Incredible Dialogue

Joint allows you to bring any gameplay mechanics or data you need on the script graph in the form of a module called **Fragment**.

Playing sounds, triggering animations, spawning actors, granting items or quests... Whatever it is, if Unreal Engine Can do it, you can make it a fragment and attach it to your dialogue.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc160e72-b8fd-4f14-aa55-3c0495c0fa4a

Joint also provides built-in fragment and asset sets for basic and common dialogue productions in Joint Native, apache 2.0 open-source Sub Plugin for Joint, to let you starts off right away!

> [!NOTE]
> In Joint Native 1.12.2, you can find 39 fragments and assets for:
> * Basic Text-Based Dialogue (Text, Text Style)
> * Audio and Dubbing Based Dialogue (Dialogue Voice, Dialogue Wave)
> * Level Sequencer Controlled Dialogue
> * Dialogue Widget Related (Custom Rendering, render size, alpha, location interpolation control, Portrait system with participants) & Participant Control
> * Player Controller Control & Player Interactions Based Dialogue Control (Wait Skip until certain players are ready, Vote between players to select next branch to move)
> * Conditional Branching & Flow Control & Conditional Playback of Fragments
> * Sub Dialogue Control
> * Networking & Localization Based Control (On Server, On Client, On Standalone, etc, Culture Specific Playback Control)
> 
> \+ There are many more than these! Check out the full list [here](https://github.com/GGgRain/Unreal-Joint-Native), and more will be added in the future update

### 2. Powerful & Intuitive, Thus Easy Scripting With Joint Graph Editor

Joint is deeply considered to be easy and intuitive to use, even for those who are not familiar with programming or scripting.

### 3. COMPLETE Multiplayer Support Via RPC & Replication for ALL FRAGMENTS

Joint is designed to be fully multiplayer compatible. Fragments in Joint can be replicated and called RPC; via them, you can easily make your fragments work in multiplayer games.

For example, watch how Vote fragment from Joint Native make between players select the next branch to move in a dialogue in the networked game!

> [!NOTE]
> You can check out the full blueprint logic for each of the nodes in [Joint Native](https://github.com/GGgRain/Unreal-Joint-Native). It's also free, So take a look!

### 4. Reactive & Dynamic Dialogue - Even in Multiplayer, Even After Localization, Even Between Clients with Different Languages

Joint uses nodes(modules) to build up whole dialogue scripts - and using modules and modular playback system has really cool advantages over time-based playback systems!

It allows you to dynamically control the total playback length and timing of elements in your dialogue—such as sounds and animations—enabling perfectly timed dialogue delivery for your players, regardless of their client's language or cultural context. This works seamlessly **even in multiplayer session** and **after localization**, **across clients using different languages**, delivering **a perfectly synchronized dialogue experience tailored to each client**.

### 5. PERFECT QOL Features

Joint provides a bunch of cool editor features that provides the perfect editing experiences that can boost your productivity and stoping you from banging your head against a wall!
